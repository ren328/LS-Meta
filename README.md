## Trait imputation
To impute trait, one should get the SNP+Metabolites matrix and the corresponding summary statistics file ready. Ginv.py is the code to impute the
trait for the standardized version with ginv method. For the non-standardized version and other methods, please refer to https://github.com/ren328/LSimputing.
